# Analyzing Tux-Racer (Commercial Edition)
i just wanted to analyze tux racer commercial edition for fun

anyways

heres some things i found:
some images were made with Software Adobe ImageReady

the directory of the tux racer source code is E:\users\jfpatry\tuxracer\tuxracer-cvs\

some leaked minimal source code of tux racer 1.1: 

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spielerkapitan/Analyzing-Tux-Racer-1.1/refs/heads/main/The%20Secret%20Uncovered.png)

after "Expression:" thats the minimal leaked source code

this also reveals why it crashes sometimes with the music enabled when you have the original sdl.dll that comes included with the game itself

i also wonder, why cant we just make somehow the c++ redistributable log the whole source code of tux racer 1.1?

# Less Technical things:

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spielerkapitan/Analyzing-Tux-Racer-Commercial-Edition/refs/heads/main/palette.png)

found this pallete of terrains in versions earlier than 1.1

as you can see, theres an test terrain called "vwall"


also theres a list of objects of tux racer 0.61 ( free version )

# Texture Matching
found texture matching in IcyCobbleStone:

The Original Texture:

![Screenshot](https://github.com/spielerkapitan/Analyzing-Tux-Racer-1.1/blob/main/desktop-wallpaper-3ds-max-texture-library.jpg?raw=true)

its from 3ds max texture library.


# Unused Content

in the folder courses in older versions than 1.1, you can find a cup called "antarctic"

the courses are still there, but these dont have any items.tcl, which i guess they originally had one.

and also theres objects with their respective .obj.strip!

based on the objects.tcl of the cup, it seems like the courses originally had a lot of objects.

screenshot of what the trophy looks:
